# WillSnake
A classic retro game written in python

This is the classic snake game written in python.
I modified the code from an example program and have added some nicieties such as a scoring system and a new background.
There is an .exe file that does not require any dependencies to run.
If you download the .py file instead you will need PyGame, SYS, OS, and Random.

This game uses the WASD keys for control.
